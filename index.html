            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I was raised in a small town just outside of Ann Arbor, Michigan.  I was surrounded by tractors on my grandpa's farm all my life and fell in love with tractors from a very young age.  I have many fond memories of fall hayrides on my grandpa's farm as a kid and sitting around roasting marshmallows.</p>
            <p>I attended college at Michigan State University where I got an undergraduate degree in Human Biology with a minor in Nutritional Sciences.  After college I discovered naturopathic medicine and decided to attend Bastyr University in Kenmore, Washington.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 2016 I packed up all of my things from Michigan and headed out West with my boyfriend at the time.  After two long years in the program I decided it wasn't for me and began looking at other career options.  I had many conversations with my aunt who is a web designer and started getting me into web development!  I fell in love immediately and am so excited to be pursuing this dream!</p>
